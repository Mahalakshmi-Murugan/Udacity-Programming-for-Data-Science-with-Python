### Programming for Data Science with Python
>To Learn the programming fundamentals required for a career in data science. Study the relational databases and interact with them using Postgre SQL language and use GIT version control tool to publish the work online. By the end of the program, you'll be able to use Python, SQL, Command Line, and Git.

### Description
This is one of the project in [Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)

### Project Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
